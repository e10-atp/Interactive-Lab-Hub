# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***The interaction should take place within an indoor setting, however since the interaction simulates crossing the street, the space should be at least 15-20 ft long and 10-15 ft wide. Ideally there would be a crosswalk printed on the ground to enhance immersion and syncronized interactive lights on each side of the street which simulate pedestrian stop-lights. The interaction can be performed by from one person to dozens of people (space permitting). Since the players take cues from the device and never the other way around, the player count is scalable in terms of device functionality. The players are essentially trying to play a game where they cross from one side of the street to another as many times as possible; each player is competing against all other the other players to get the highest number of crosses. As with a normal stop light, the device will light white when it is legal to walk and red when walking is not permitted. Players can choose to "jay-walk" during a red light to increase their scores over law abiding players, however with a certain probablility there will be police patroling the streets on red lights (indicated by the device suddenly flashing red and blue and playing a siren sound). If the player is still on the street by the time the siren stops they will be taken to jail and held out for a period of time. Essentially, the players will watch the device and use it to determine risk/reward for scoring points.**\*\*

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

![Story Board](https://github.com/e10-atp/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/storyboard.jpg)

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***The interaction seemed interesting and fun if not a bit complicated. Nobody understood the second panel of my story board because it was too complicated (and it was also a meme reference). The motivations behind using the device were unclear besides for playing a game.**\*\*


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Walking back and forth sounds fine on paper, but gets repititive when you actually do it. It also gets tiring fast when walking with larger "street" sizes. The enjoyment from interacting with the device alone is much less than in a group.**\*\*

\*\***There could be ways to make the interactive game more fun through variety and randomness, however that would require a more complex device. Ideas include: showing icons, having multiple sounds, automatic "on/off street" detection via computer vision or pressure pads, randomized police siren lengths, double bonus-points time.**\*\*


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Tinkerbelle was a little hard to use over campus wifi. Worked after changing the port number. The Tinkerbell button would not clear the color palettes on iOS.**\*\*


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***![Wizarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fATc_1ad9Fo)**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

![Costume Design](https://github.com/e10-atp/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/costume.jpg)

\*\***The device is designed to give the players an immersive feeling of being in the game and having the theme of crossing a real street. Because interaction with the device is mainly from visual cues, the device should ideally be large, readable, and eye-catching, however, the use of a phone as a substitute limits its effectiveness due to size. The device should also be out of the way for players to freely move around without worrying about bumping into anything.**\*\*


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Collaborations credits go to Matt Ardizone and Calvin Ying; my roommates, sources of feedback, and star cast for the video. Also to primary school gym class, which may or may not have embedded this game into my subconcious.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
